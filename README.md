> A new todo list project based on Flutter.

The idea of front-end style comes from [this video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Jt411u7RD)(extremely recommend this coder), in which the app is based on Swift. Shamefully, I'm not familiar with Swift, but on the contrary, I can rebuild it by Flutter. And I've just done that!

## Getting Started

Yet another todo list app totally based on flutter.

You can build the app from the source code or you can quickly download the [release apk](https://github.com/Rogerskelamen/flodo/releases) (android provided only)

If you want to modify the app in your own way, welcome and enjoy yourself!
